## My Experience: 


As an aspiring SOC analyst, completing the Google Cybersecurity Course was an exciting milestone in my journey. This dedicated training not only equipped me with essential cybersecurity skills but also immersed me in a diverse range of industry tools and frameworks.

Exploring each tool for the first time was a thrill. From SIEMs and Wireshark to Splunk, I found hands-on learning incredibly engaging. Mastering Python, SQL, and Linux added depth to my technical arsenal, while understanding TCPdump and frameworks like NIST CSF & RSF provided insight into their pivotal roles in enterprise cybersecurity strategies worldwide.

The course introduced me to concepts like Cryptography and essential security tools such as IDS/IPS systems like Suricata and Snort, which are critical components of any organization's defense.

This experience not only fueled my enthusiasm for cybersecurity but also solidified my determination to excel as a SOC analyst, equipped with practical skills and a deeper understanding of cybersecurity frameworks and tools.
